# Implementation Notes

## Completed Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created a new Xcode project for iOS using SwiftUI
   - Set up the basic project structure

2. **Info.plist Configuration**
   - Added required permissions:
     - `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` for voice input
     - `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` for speech-to-text
     - `NSUserNotificationUsageDescription` for reminders

3. **UI Development**
   - Created a basic UI with:
     - A prompt display
     - A recording button with microphone icon
     - A text area for transcription display
     - Save and discard buttons
   - Applied the style guide (colors, fonts, rounded corners)

4. **Notification Manager**
   - Implemented a singleton `NotificationManager` class
   - Added methods for requesting permissions
   - Added methods for scheduling notifications at 8 AM and every 30 minutes

5. **Speech Recognition**
   - Implemented a singleton `SpeechManager` class
   - Added methods for requesting permissions
   - Added methods for starting and stopping recording
   - Set up handlers for transcription updates and errors

## Remaining Issues

1. **Integration Issues**
   - There are reference issues between ContentView and the manager classes
   - Need to properly import and reference the manager classes in ContentView

2. **Platform Compatibility**
   - AVAudioSession is showing as unavailable in macOS (this is expected as it's an iOS-only API)
   - Need to ensure the app is properly configured for iOS deployment

3. **Local Storage**
   - Need to implement persistent storage for journal entries
   - Currently entries are only printed to the console

4. **Testing**
   - Need to test notifications in the simulator
   - Need to test speech recognition in the simulator
   - Need to verify error handling for various scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Fix the integration issues between ContentView and manager classes
2. Implement local storage for journal entries
3. Test the app thoroughly in the simulator
4. Prepare for Phase 2 implementation
